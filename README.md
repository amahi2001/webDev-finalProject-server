# CSCI 39548: Web Development
## Final Project: Campus Management System. Server Side
### username: amahi2001
<br/>

The primary focus of this application is to provide a robust backend powered by Express and PostgreSQL for the Campus Management Client. Its main objective is to facilitate seamless CRUD operations concerning both Campuses and Students. By leveraging the power of Express and PostgreSQL, the application ensures efficient and reliable data management, enhancing the overall user experience.

<br/>

## Note
The project expects the server to be running on `port 8080`. If you wish to change the port, you must do so manually on the server side as well as the client side:
- on the client side change the baseURL in `app.js`

<br/>

## Installation (Server side)
1. Ensure that postgres DB is running locally on `port 5432`
2. Ensure that [client side](https://github.com/amahi2001/webDev-finalProject-client) is running on `port 3000`
3. Clone the repository
4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
5. Run `npm run start` or `make run` to start the application
